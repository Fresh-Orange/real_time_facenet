# real_time_facenet
Detect and identify the face in camera using [facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet), which is a tensorFlow implementation of the face recognizer described in the paper
["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832). All I did was extract what I thought was the most useful file from the original project and add the camera data extraction code to the original file. For more detail about facenet, you'd better read [original project](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)

## How to use the project
First, download any one of the pretrained facenet model. Second, place your face dataset in `dataset_without_align` directory. And then ...

|    OS    | method |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Windows | Modify the model directory path in `train_predict.bat`, then double click it to train model and predict|
| Linux | Open `train_predic.bat` and you'll know how to run those commands since you are suing linux |
